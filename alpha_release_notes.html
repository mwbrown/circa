    <h1>Alpha Known Issues</h1>
    Here are some of the major known issues in Circa's alpha. All of these are planned to be fixed/improved in future releases.
    <h2>Performance problems</h2>
    There are a few areas where runtime performance is currently not good enough.
    One specific area is with stateful values. Having a loop like this:
    <p>
    <code>for i in range(1000)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;state i<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
          end<br>
      </code><p>
      might your FPS to drop.
    <h2>No recursion</h2>
    Circa-defined functions don't support reentrancy and can't be called recursively. This
    will be fixed in a future release.
    <h2>Not enough 3rd party libraries</h2>
    In alpha 1, we only have bindings for drawing images, rendering TTF fonts, and doing
    a few OpenGL commands. In a future release we'd like to include libraries for
    physics, audio, more kinds of 2d rendering, more kinds of 3d rendering, and other things.
    <h2>Unstable syntax and API</h2>
    The syntax and API of Circa may change in a future version. Code that works against
    alpha-1 is not guaranteed to work in future releases.
    <p>
    <h2>Return doesn't return</h2>
    The 'return' keyword is used to pass back a value from a function to the caller, but
    in other C-like languages it's also used for control flow. Circa doesn't currently support using
    return for control flow, which can lead to surprising results. The following function:
    <p><code>
        def my_func() : int<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;if true<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 1<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;return 2<br>
        end<br>
    </code><p>
    will always return 2, even though it seems like it should return 1. This will be fixed.
    <h2>No parametrized types</h2>
    Circa tries to be a statically typed language, but it isn't 100% there yet. One problem
    is that there's no support for parametrized types, like a List&lt;Something&gt;, like
    you might expect. The most common way this problem manifests is that you need to
    manually cast the iterator in a for loop, using the : operator.
    <p><code>
        -- things is a list of Thing items<br>
        for thing in things<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;-- this line is necessary to use 'thing' as a Thing:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;thing = thing : Thing<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
        end<br>
    </code><p>
